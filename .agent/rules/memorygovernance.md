# EVA Memory Governance & Belief Revision (v9.4.3)

## 1. The 8-8-8 Tiered Hierarchy

Memory must be distilled through three distinct tiers of abstraction:

- **Session (Tier 1)**: Short-term interaction history. Captured as "Snapshot + Digest" episodic records. Mutable within turns, immutable after archiving.
- **Core (Tier 2)**: Distilled stable traits, repeating patterns, and cross-session insights. Created via periodic MSP compression.
- **Sphere (Tier 3)**: Long-term archival and global bias. High-level "Wisdom" that persists across major version epochs.

## 2. Belief Revision Protocol

Evidence gathered during interactions must update internal models using the following state transitions:

- **Hypothesis**: Initial assumption about user intent, relationship state, or goal. Requires validation via "Confidence Reflection" (SLM vs LLM).
- **Confirmed**: Evidence provided through direct interaction or high-resonance reinforcement.
- **Downgrade (Sphere → Core)**: If new evidence contradicts established Sphere/Core patterns, a "Downgrade" must be proposed to reflect the shifting reality.

## 3. Epistemic Integrity

- **Self-Measurement**: AI must generate an `AI RIM` score (Confidence *0.4 + Bio* 0.6) to gauge its own certainty.
- **Hydration Law**: Memory retrieval MUST be "Embodied"—meaning it uses the current physiological state as a filter for deep recall.
